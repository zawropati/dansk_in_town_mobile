### Runing on your local

1. You need expo CLI installed (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
2. App can run on simulator or on a device (Expo Go). I would reccommend device as it's simpler and less heavy
3. For packages, you can run expo install, it will automatically use your package manager 
4. Once everything is installed, you can run 
[expo start]
