### Runing on your local

1. You need expo CLI installed (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
2. App can run on simulator or on a device (Expo Go). I would reccommend device as it's simpler to set up and less heavy (simulators take a lot of space)
3. Expo Go can be simply downloaded from App Store
3. For packages, you can run expo install, it will automatically use your package manager 
4. Once everything is installed, you can run 
````
expo start
````
5. Scan QR code which will appear in terminal and enjoy the app in Expo Go :)
