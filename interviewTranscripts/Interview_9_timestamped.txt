[00:00 - 00:09] So I don't have to.  Right. So I'm going to start with some introduction and then we're going to move on to the questions 
[00:09 - 00:16] regarding the app. So I know I just have to ask you what's your occupation, age and nationality? 
[00:16 - 00:23] Wait, again, my occupation, so work, like work. Yeah. 
[00:23 - 00:30] So I'm a student.  I also work. And then I'm Finnish and my age is 25. 
[00:30 - 00:36] OK. And what would you say is your level of Danish? 
[00:36 - 00:44] I'm fluent in Swedish, so I am. I don't speak Danish. 
[00:44 - 00:49] But I do understand it quite well, especially when it's written.  OK. With my Swedish. 
[00:49 - 00:54] But I haven't been studying Danish.  It's just that like Swedish and Danish are so similar. So yeah. 
[00:54 - 01:00] So are you attending Danish classes? I mean, you just said, but just to you're not attending Danish classes, right? 
[01:00 - 01:08] Not right now.  I started, but I quit because it doesn't work. OK, so you stopped because you didn't have enough time for it. 
[01:08 - 01:13] Yeah, exactly.  Yeah. And are you using any mobile apps for learning Danish? 
[01:13 - 01:23] No, I tried Duolingo and then obviously your app. It's more about me not being enough persistent. 
[01:23 - 01:32] I would love to use mobile apps, but I feel that like then I'm just doing something else with my phone instead of using those apps. 
[01:32 - 01:41] But I think they're a great idea.  I think I just have to motivate myself to use them. OK, so it's more about your own motivation, basically. 
[01:41 - 01:48] And like, yeah, I'm into it and stuff.  Yeah, exactly. But I think they're a good way to learn. 
[01:48 - 01:56] I don't know how well would you learn?  I think for me, like. Because I know Swedish, so I have like a huge level up in my Danish. 
[01:56 - 02:04] So I feel like those kind of apps would help me to learn a few words because I need to learn words because I, you know, some words are different. 
[02:04 - 02:11] Right.  Makes sense. And but in theory or like in general, would you say you want to learn Danish? 
[02:11 - 02:19] Yes.  That's your goal?  Yes.  Yes, definitely. And I think those kind of apps can make it, you know, fast or easy way. 
[02:20 - 02:26] Very approachable, right? Like apps to, you know, to learn, I think. 
[02:26 - 02:35] So if there would be something now that's stopping you, I think what you mentioned already, it's basically the time that you don't have right now to commit to fully learning Danish 
[02:35 - 02:40] and also the motivation a little bit.  Yeah.  OK. Right. 
[02:40 - 02:46] So now let's start with the app. So did you feel the motivation to use the app? 
[02:46 - 02:54] And if you felt it, like what was motivating you and if there was no motivation or any ideas, what could motivate you more? 
[02:54 - 03:04] Yes.  OK, let me open that. So first of all, I think I only took a few pictures in the first days because I found 
[03:04 - 03:09] it difficult to like when I'm walking in a city that I would be taking pictures at the same time. 
[03:09 - 03:19] So like it was impossible for me because when I'm going from place to place, I am in a hurry. So then like I don't have time to like be taking pictures. 
[03:19 - 03:25] But what would be good, because I do like running, so I should maybe go for runs and then maybe at the same time take pictures. 
[03:25 - 03:32] Because like I think the idea is great, but maybe once again, time and motivation, like, you know, I'm always doing something else. 
[03:32 - 03:42] So taking pictures feels like troublesome. But I think at the same time, I like the idea, you know, because like there is often like 
[03:42 - 03:48] words that I don't understand and then taking a picture and then, you know, learning them. Then in the app, there is this level. 
[03:49 - 04:00] Wait, so I think it should be in the practice page. It's just like your level and like you have to 10 more words so you can level up. 
[04:01 - 04:08] But it never leveled up for me.  So I think that kind of thing is like a very good motivation. Like, OK, I need to do 10 words today and then I can go to the next level. 
[04:08 - 04:20] It's kind of like rewarding.  So I think that was very good, but I think it didn't work.  But I think that's a great thing to have there. And then in general, I think it's a funny idea to have those pictures and then like you can 
[04:20 - 04:30] see the context for the word and then you can find a translation for it from those like you can choose. I think it's a nice like, you know, have a picture of a context and then have a 
[04:30 - 04:36] word and then you have to find a correct alternative. So I think that's a good way. 
[04:36 - 04:43] For me, I think it was quite easy with my Swedish. So you mean that context? 
[04:43 - 04:49] Are you talking about the exercises where you could see and you can pick which word is that or what? 
[04:49 - 04:57] I mean, the context that you can see from the picture, what is the context? And it can help you understanding like what is what it is. 
[04:58 - 05:06] That makes sense. Very good feedback. So in general, how much would you say you were using into taking photos and how much were you 
[05:06 - 05:12] using the exercises?  Were you using the exercises at all? So I was only taking one. 
[05:12 - 05:21] I think I only took like two photos. I was and then because you wanted me to use the app like a few minutes every day, so then 
[05:21 - 05:29] like I didn't use it every day. But then when I was using it, I was using it to practice and go through someone else's words. 
[05:29 - 05:39] Unfortunately, I never saw my own pictures. But now when I think I also did it wrong because I took a picture of a sentence instead of 
[05:39 - 05:49] of a word or like I translated the whole word, no whole sentence and not just one word. So I never saw like my picture to come up for me. 
[05:50 - 05:56] That shouldn't be the issue. But I think the thing is that there is like 230 pictures right now. 
[05:56 - 06:07] So maybe I'm lucky, but there is also something that I need to work on with the how the pictures are getting proposed to people, because I heard already some feedback that they're 
[06:07 - 06:13] repetitive. So maybe there is something. Yeah, I think there is if there is 200 like that many pictures, I think it's very 
[06:13 - 06:25] repetitive because I had like same pictures coming over and over for me. And also I think it's annoying that based on the first letter, I can see which word it's 
[06:25 - 06:34] going to be. So I think you have to be case insensitive.  Is that the word? Yes. So it's very easy because you can just like not even knowing the word, you can figure out 
[06:34 - 06:40] which one is the correct one.  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Because of the case of uppercase and lowercase sometimes. 
[06:40 - 06:52] And also very often there is a case where you have the word in Danish and then there is the four English alternatives and two of the English alternatives is the correct answer. 
[06:53 - 07:01] Like you it's like doubled like the correct answer.  So that is also kind of easy. But there is also like a bug. 
[07:02 - 07:13] And yeah.  Cool. And really nice. And so you said you were using it kind of daily, but a few minutes per day or what would 
[07:13 - 07:24] you say? It was like when I just started to use it, it was very catchy, you know, like to practice because like it was nice and you get like when you get it correct, you have this 
[07:24 - 07:33] pop up like correct. And like, yeah, it was I think I think it was nice when you just started to use it when 
[07:33 - 07:41] you were practicing. And yeah, when I don't I didn't count, I didn't measure time, but I was like kind of quite immersed. 
[07:41 - 07:47] Like when I was using it, I was like, you know, it was catchy. Then it was it would have just been nice to have. 
[07:47 - 07:55] Yeah, this this one.  I'm still on my level one. That's really weird. So that's a bug. 
[07:56 - 08:03] Yeah, so. Yeah, so it's always just says like 10 words missing judge the next level. 
[08:03 - 08:11] I think it's because maybe there is a misunderstanding because what it measures is how many pictures you added, not what you were practicing. 
[08:11 - 08:21] So if you only one picture. OK, but I think you were right with the maybe there is something to think about with the 
[08:21 - 08:33] levels being connected to the practice and not to how many people. Yeah, I mean, well, I guess that's like you have to bring the message in a clear way. 
[08:33 - 08:43] And then, yeah, I guess I think it's also great to have, you know, like how many pictures you put. But for me, I was only using it to like practice from other people's pictures. 
[08:43 - 08:51] So then for me, it was annoying that I never leveled up because like, you know, for me, it's very encouraging to be like, oh, like I leveled up. 
[08:51 - 09:02] Right. Yeah.  Makes sense. Yeah.  Very nice. OK. And also this one, this one doesn't work like see the C translations like this one. 
[09:03 - 09:09] Nothing happens here. Because in theory, there should be a list of your pictures that you added there. 
[09:09 - 09:15] And then I don't know why you said you added something, but there is nothing that's really. I did. Yeah. 
[09:15 - 09:27] Yeah. In theory, but also like when I did the picture, like I feel like the. Where you type keyboard, it didn't go down. 
[09:28 - 09:38] So that was kind of annoying.  OK. OK. All right. 
[09:38 - 09:43] So.  But now it works, actually. Now it works. So now it works. 
[09:44 - 09:51] I never saw this when I was first taking picture.  I was kind of. Didn't work, but now I think it works. 
[09:51 - 10:01] OK. Yeah.  It's weird.  No bug anymore.  No bug. Also, also in the first days, why I got annoyed was like it had a very long loading time. 
[10:02 - 10:08] But I mean, after I am implementing, it has a long loading time too. So I understand. 
[10:09 - 10:20] Many, many people told me that.  And I think it's because I'm not really releasing it in a normal way. So because it's using like server at the third party and then there is back and that's also a 
[10:20 - 10:31] third party. It takes so long to like everything to get connected because it's also free service. So I hope that would be faster when I actually like do it like a proper release. 
[10:32 - 10:38] But yeah, that's annoying.  I know many people were like, is it even working because it's loading so long? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. 
[10:38 - 10:46] So sometimes like I didn't practice on that day because it was just loading. I think it got faster and then I kind of learned that it's OK, it's just slow. 
[10:46 - 10:56] So then I learned to wait for it.  Be gentle. Also, like, you know, I'm also implementing an app and I have a very long loading time on my 
[10:56 - 11:06] computation. So I understand. OK, I think you answered it a little bit, but if you would have to pinpoint what was 
[11:06 - 11:14] actually prompting you to open the app daily, was it like something that you've seen or just like a memory in your head or what was it? 
[11:16 - 11:23] I wanted to be liable or loyal for you to use it every day. So I think that was the main reason. 
[11:23 - 11:33] I think I wouldn't use it without that, without that feeling that I wanted to help out. But that goes also to Duolingo, like it wasn't necessarily your app. 
[11:36 - 11:42] But if I would have the motivation that we talked earlier, I would, you know, then I would just literally want to learn. 
[11:42 - 11:48] And I think your app is like.  I think it's a good way to learn. I think it's great. I think it is fun. 
[11:48 - 11:54] Like, I think the idea is fun. What would you say, like apart from the app and like if you step back, if you would think 
[11:54 - 12:01] about just like motivating to learn the language, is there something that you think it's going to happen maybe after you finish the studies? 
[12:02 - 12:12] Like, what would you see in the world motivating you to learn the language? I think the reward that the app can give me, like, you know, like the level up, I think 
[12:12 - 12:19] that was a fun thing.  And kind of like give like small targets. I think Duolingo does that, like sending me like messages like, OK, I haven't seen you in 
[12:19 - 12:27] an app in a while. And then obviously, what is much more kind of a bigger issue or like, you know, a bigger 
[12:27 - 12:35] thing that is maybe more difficult for you to approach as a developer. But like, you know, how well do I learn from the app, you know? 
[12:35 - 12:44] But that's I think the whole different question, which is not made for a developer thing. But if I what would actually motivate me the most to learn the language, I think 
[12:44 - 12:49] what would actually motivate me the most would be like if I can see like, oh, this is actually helping me to learn the language. 
[12:50 - 12:58] So then that would motivate me. But I think that's also pedagogical and like about the context. 
[13:00 - 13:07] But I think the app is catchy, which I already said, and I think it could like be, you know, partial. 
[13:09 - 13:18] It could have its part in my language learning. But maybe the best way for me is like, you know, talk with James and like maybe I need 
[13:18 - 13:25] maybe a little bit more than just an app. I think I think the app is kind of like a nice app, like a plus. 
[13:25 - 13:33] I mean, it's actually it's supposed to be I mean, it's made in a way that it's not supposed to be like a replacement for a class. 
[13:33 - 13:40] So I think it's spot on that it's supposed to just maybe help you a little bit. But you're not going to be fluent after that. 
[13:42 - 13:49] OK, but was there something like particularly interesting to you, I guess that would be the exercises which you mentioned, not really the pictures, right? 
[13:50 - 13:55] No. Yeah, but the pictures are also fun, right? I think the exercises are something that you can find from multiple different platforms. 
[13:55 - 14:01] That's something that multiple platforms have. I think the pictures are some is something I have never come across before. 
[14:02 - 14:11] So I think in a sense, I think it also makes your product unique. So I think it was I think the pictures are nice and I would love to be more interested 
[14:11 - 14:19] in taking pictures. But for me. In the life and the mindset where I'm right now, I don't have time to stop 
[14:19 - 14:29] and take pictures, but like I think it's also I kind of have to just learn to use it and get it as part of my daily life, my routine. 
[14:29 - 14:37] And then I think I would enjoy to be taking pictures. I think I think it's a good way to learn also take pictures. 
[14:38 - 14:51] OK, so is there something that you think you would engage you more like can be anything like notifications or other features like something that would bring you more to use 
[14:51 - 15:00] it? Maybe that like I could like when I take a picture instead of typing the word, which is also important for learning purposes, but I could just like, you know, there would be 
[15:00 - 15:05] artificial intelligence. I can just like, you know, the picture would see the word that here's the word and I 
[15:05 - 15:11] could just like kind of cut it and put it to the text field if I would make it faster and easier. I think definitely. 
[15:12 - 15:20] OK, really cool. And I know you didn't make another pictures, but just to know, did you feel any different 
[15:20 - 15:33] about your surroundings after making those pictures or thinking about the app? Again, I didn't understand your question. 
[15:33 - 15:42] Like, did I start to like look at the surroundings more after using the app? Yeah, like notice the words or think about, oh, maybe there is this one and I want to 
[15:42 - 15:48] make a picture of that or something like that. Yeah. Because like, absolutely. 
[15:48 - 15:54] Like, I think it would like help me to be more aware around like around from my surroundings, like what kind of words do I see around? 
[15:55 - 16:06] But maybe also one thing that can like affect is that I understand a lot what I see around. So maybe that's why also like I don't take pictures because it's not often 
[16:06 - 16:17] that I see a sign which I don't understand. So then it's, you know, so then, yeah, or like I can because the picture is it gives 
[16:17 - 16:25] you a context and then it's easier to understand what it says. But usually, you know, when I see the word in the context with my own eyes, then I can 
[16:25 - 16:35] already understand. So maybe for me, it would be more like. Because the pictures that I took were from a newspaper, so for me, like enough difficult 
[16:35 - 16:46] vocabulary would come from like, you know, from a newspaper where I think the information is much more like more words and more verbose, whereas, you know, outside 
[16:46 - 16:53] there's just signs like, you know, trash can or like recycling or like, I don't know, dentist or something. 
[16:53 - 17:03] So like, yeah, I might also affect. But do you feel like you it could make you more interested in the vocabulary, but in 
[17:03 - 17:11] the way like maybe more difficult words and like. Absolutely. For me, I think because like right now, the level of the app was very, very 
[17:11 - 17:21] easy. I usually always got it correct. So maybe like also like instead of well, then it would also need me more time from me, 
[17:21 - 17:28] but I would also be typing the words because like going from Danish to English is very easy for me. But going from English to Danish is much harder. 
[17:29 - 17:40] So maybe like kind of reverse it, that give the English word and see then Danish translations or like, you know, give more options for the user and just this one path, 
[17:40 - 17:47] like one kind of user flow, which is like see picture, see the Danish word and then see the English translations. 
[17:48 - 17:56] So kind of maybe flip it a bit to like see the English word and then Danish translations or like then you have to write the Danish translation. 
[17:58 - 18:06] OK, so maybe no more like technical question. I think you already touched upon that a little bit, but do you have any more comments on 
[18:06 - 18:17] the upload flow? So everything from clicking the button, making the picture and saving it? Or like user friendly or what would you do? 
[18:17 - 18:27] Oh yeah, so right now, OK, so because I never actually saw it in a way that I see it right now, because as I said, it kind of didn't work when I did it the first place. 
[18:27 - 18:35] So. Yeah, I think it's great. 
[18:36 - 18:45] Yeah, I don't have that much to say about it, because like when I was using it, it didn't work, so I couldn't see like this part here because my keyboard was blocking 
[18:45 - 18:57] it. But on a quick note, I don't see any problem.  I think it is user friendly. And if you would say how was it, how easy was the application to use? 
[18:57 - 19:04] Obviously you had some bugs, but if you would have to just like with navigation, everything, was it clear what you're supposed to do? 
[19:05 - 19:20] Yeah. So I think. There is some functionalities that I don't understand. 
[19:20 - 19:29] Well, I guess like because there is some bugs, like I can't see the pictures like here. And then I think this was I was completely confused about what is this measuring? 
[19:31 - 19:40] Yeah, I didn't know about what it is measuring. And I never got my own pictures, which was a shame. 
[19:40 - 19:47] Maybe you could also like I took the picture. Maybe you could also prioritize those because those are probably the words I don't know. 
[19:54 - 20:01] I don't know. You have a camera sign and then it says home. Maybe that's kind of two very confusing things, because usually home is like, you know, 
[20:01 - 20:07] some kind of front page instead of a picture functionality. Well, you have a camera which is. 
[20:08 - 20:15] Indicating that you take a picture, but then like I don't know that a camera and home are usually like the same functionality. 
[20:23 - 20:32] And I don't know if the practice and then this language, I think this icon means language. I mean, if you want icons, I guess that's the best icon for it. 
[20:33 - 20:41] There is, I think, some like, you know, I think you have to kind of use it a few times in order to kind of learn, learn the mappings inside of the app. 
[20:41 - 20:49] Like what do those different icons mean? I think they may be a little bit like, you know, haven't seen those like connections 
[20:49 - 20:56] before between like, you know, text like what the what the text is for the icon. So maybe there is like some confusions for me. 
[20:57 - 21:08] Like it wasn't that intuitive, but I don't know how to make it more intuitive. But I wouldn't maybe necessarily have camera and home on the same like, you know, have 
[21:08 - 21:14] like maybe take a picture and then the camera.  Or, yeah. Yeah, that's really good point, I think. 
[21:17 - 21:25] So now that's like wrapping it up.  What would you what did you like the most? What did you like the most from the app? 
[21:26 - 21:38] OK, so. So I did like the practice, maybe the practice part was because that's what I was using, 
[21:38 - 21:47] so probably I liked the most the practice part because it was also very easy and like, yeah, once it just loaded the pictures, it was working very well. 
[21:47 - 21:58] And if I was if I was a different person, I would also like or like I think it was a nice idea, this taking pictures. 
[21:58 - 22:04] I think it was a fun idea. I just didn't use it because it felt too time consuming to stop and take a picture. 
[22:05 - 22:15] But I knew practice was fun.  OK, but nice. And maybe also seeing like someone else's pictures felt kind of very personal to like 
[22:15 - 22:22] have someone else been taking a picture. And maybe there was some of my friends because, you know, we know some same people. 
[22:22 - 22:29] So, yeah, I couldn't identify any other people. It was a fun idea that, OK, my friends might have been taking a picture. 
[22:30 - 22:35] Like the social aspect of it.  It's yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. OK. 
[22:37 - 22:45] Maybe you could like have some social aspect onto it, like. You know, there is like the real where you take like pictures of your own life. 
[22:45 - 22:51] So. You know, I don't know, like maybe like I don't know now it is anonymous. 
[22:51 - 23:00] I don't know.  But maybe like have like a tag like who took this picture.  I don't know. You know, everyone would have a name tag like I took this picture like, you know, 
[23:00 - 23:06] Sue Page.  I don't know. Yeah.  Might be fun.  Like a social aspect. Yeah. 
[23:06 - 23:11] Yeah. And I think you already said as well a little bit, but just maybe if you could 
[23:11 - 23:22] point like one or two main things that you think they're missing in the app. Yeah. So more encouraging with the level ups, I think that would be very important 
[23:22 - 23:33] for me. I don't know, it's more functionality and more to implement, but maybe like 
[23:33 - 23:43] different ways to do the practices, like have different practice sections or like, you know, have them like implement inside that like, you know, that there would be 
[23:43 - 23:52] different tasks, not always like the same because it is quite repetitive. If you do it like for five minutes, so you have been doing five minutes, the same 
[23:52 - 23:58] task. So maybe it will be interesting with different tasks. So you mean like different types of exercises, not only. 
[23:58 - 24:11] Yeah. Not only like from Danish to those English alternatives. OK. And the last thing is that would you advise or like recommend the app to someone 
[24:11 - 24:22] else?  Absolutely. Like I think. I think this was like the first prototype, so like I'm sure like I think like when you 
[24:22 - 24:30] just improve it, I think it's like I would for sure like recommend.  I think it was a very fun way. I like it with the pictures and like the practice. 
[24:32 - 24:34] That's it. I'm going to stop recording.
