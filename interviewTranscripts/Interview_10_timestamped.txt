[00:00 - 00:17] Okay, let's start. All right, so what's your occupation, age and nationality? Yeah, student, 28 and yeah, from the US. 
[00:19 - 00:30] And what's your level of Danish? I would say like conversational, like elementary level maybe or like... 
[00:32 - 00:43] And are you attending any Danish classes right now? Not at the time, but I have completed the like first four modules. 
[00:44 - 00:51] And why did you stop attending? It was no longer free. 
[00:51 - 01:00] Okay, and are you using any apps for learning Danish? Obviously, except the one we're talking about. 
[01:02 - 01:13] Uh, I have Duolingo, but I don't use it actively. Is there like a specific reason for stopping it? Or was it never like a thing? 
[01:13 - 01:24] Maybe mostly just like time. And if you would have to say like in general, do you want to learn Danish? 
[01:24 - 01:31] Is that like a goal of yours?  Yeah, definitely. Okay, cool. So now about the app. 
[01:31 - 01:38] Did you feel motivated to use the app?  Uh, yeah. Okay, cool. 
[01:39 - 01:47] Cool. And how much were you using it for the photos? And how much was it for the exercises? So the practice part? 
[01:48 - 01:59] Yeah, I thought that like the practice part was probably where I used it the most. And also is like part of that why it was nice, 
[01:59 - 02:06] maybe like compared to something like Duolingo is that there's no... Like you can do as many as you want, I guess. 
[02:06 - 02:12] Like it's more on your own pace. Uh, and then I took a few photos. 
[02:14 - 02:26] But I think it was like, it was more often if I was like bored and doing nothing, then I would think about, oh, yeah, I should like use that the app and to practice 
[02:26 - 02:33] versus like when I'm out and about. I'm also just like really bad in general about taking pictures. 
[02:34 - 02:40] Okay.  Like, like I don't take photos a lot. Like I don't have very many photos on my camera roll. 
[02:40 - 02:51] So like I could also be maybe like, you know, an outlier in that way. But I like the practice feature quite a lot. 
[02:52 - 02:58] All right. So if you would have to say how often you were using it, 
[02:58 - 03:03] was it daily or every other day? And was it for a few minutes or a bit longer? 
[03:04 - 03:10] I think the practice part of it, at least I tried to use like every day, maybe just a few minutes. 
[03:14 - 03:23] And was it anything, was there something specific that was prompting you to open the app? Something around you or was it just your memory? 
[03:25 - 03:35] Yeah, I think it was often just if like, you know, I'm on my phone and kind of feel like there's nothing, like there was nothing to look at or something, 
[03:35 - 03:44] then I would go into that and then be like, yeah, check if there's, you know, there's more photos uploaded and stuff. 
[03:45 - 03:53] Okay.  I think you touched upon that a little bit already, but was there something specific that made you interested in the app? 
[03:53 - 03:59] So you felt like you want to come back to it?  I guess that's the practice part, right? For you. 
[04:00 - 04:08] Yeah, that would be the practice part the most. And I mean, I like the idea that like the general database or like library is also like user. 
[04:11 - 04:17] Like, yeah, you know, crowd based. Populate like user populated data. 
[04:18 - 04:26] And then, yeah, I think it's would be a bit, it like motivates you a bit as well, I guess, if you're using the practice, like, since you know, 
[04:26 - 04:35] other people are adding to it, like to try to add something as well.  Mm hmm. And do you have any like ideas can be anything? 
[04:35 - 04:42] And of course, if you don't, that's fine. But is there anything that you think would engage you more into the app? 
[04:42 - 04:53] Maybe use it longer or make more pictures or whatever that could be? Yeah, I guess like one thing that would be cool would be 
[04:55 - 05:03] also like a level system for the practice. Would maybe be a cool idea. 
[05:03 - 05:08] But at the same time, I guess like I didn't take that many photos and there already was a level system. 
[05:10 - 05:16] So I guess that's kind of contradicting itself. But I still feel like, you know, like more of like some of the gamification model 
[05:18 - 05:27] could be cool or like ability to connect with like other users. Or at least have like, if not connect with them have like some sort of leaderboard. 
[05:28 - 05:34] Mm hmm. For both like practice like words and also uploads. 
[05:36 - 05:43] Right. And now, did you feel any different about your surroundings? 
[05:43 - 05:55] Of course, in the context of Denmark and Danish? Oh, yeah, I guess because like, I can kind of read Danish decently, 
[05:56 - 06:08] that I don't like, think maybe about as much like what's in English and what's not. But then when I knew that, okay, I should try to like, take some photos for the app. 
[06:09 - 06:16] It kind of like put me in like the perspective from years ago, maybe like when I moved here and like the idea of like, okay, you really don't know. 
[06:18 - 06:23] Like what actually there is a lot of stuff that's like just in Danish, that maybe you don't know what it means. 
[06:23 - 06:36] And it's can have some important, maybe be some important information. Okay, so maybe that doesn't make that much sense, since you said that, you know, 
[06:36 - 06:46] Danish, but did it potentially made you more interested in learning it again, or like coming back to the classes or improving your Danish? 
[06:47 - 06:56] Yeah, I guess like the whole idea of just like having a database of like, pictures you've uploaded and like stuff you've practiced, it gives you or like, 
[06:56 - 07:03] at least I guess I felt like the idea of like, especially by seeing a sign or something that I didn't know, 
[07:03 - 07:15] like, oh, I should know what that means or...  Okay. So what it was more like a review for you or something like that just reminded you, 
[07:15 - 07:21] just reminded you I used to learn that maybe I should actually know that word. Yeah, yeah, definitely. 
[07:23 - 07:30] And now a bit more technical. So do you have any comments on the flow when you upload the picture? 
[07:30 - 07:36] So everything from clicking the button to translating to actually saving the picture in your library? 
[07:40 - 08:07] Is it fine that I just look at the app real quick?  Yeah, for sure.  Of course. I think it was like, the one comment I had maybe was 
[08:07 - 08:13] when you go into like, just maybe the flow of like practicing your own library, 
[08:15 - 08:26] that like you can see it in library, but like also if there was a way to get to it from practice, if that makes sense. 
[08:27 - 08:32] Yeah, makes sense.  That's actually lots of people brought it up.  So I think that's something. Okay. 
[08:33 - 08:40] Yeah. And also, it's probably getting into more like actually research about like, 
[08:41 - 08:56] what do you call it, like education or like pedagogy about like, when do you know a word? And maybe having like, you know, something in your library or like in a practice 
[08:56 - 09:04] sort of library or something that's like, maybe if you've gotten a word right, three times or whatever it is that it's like, you know, you, okay, you know this, 
[09:05 - 09:13] to like have a track of that as well.  Yeah. So basically, if you already, for example, came across one word three times, 
[09:13 - 09:18] you shouldn't see it for some time. Because yeah, yeah. 
[09:18 - 09:28] And maybe you have like, you have the data somewhere as well as to like, what words you've mastered, like, even if it's someone else's photo that it like shows up in your like, 
[09:28 - 09:42] known library or something.  That would be cool.  That's a good idea. I also think like, opposed to like, Google or something where you know, you just, you take, 
[09:42 - 09:49] you can use like the live translator or whatever. I think the whole idea of like the photo library or that you could also have like, 
[09:49 - 09:57] like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, yeah, yeah, that you have your own photo libraries, like, 
[09:57 - 10:03] makes it a cool idea in a way for like, traveling. Sure. 
[10:03 - 10:13] Because you know, like, at least I know, like a lot of Americans when they travel, then they always use the like auto translator, like, but the image one, 
[10:13 - 10:23] but it's also I think like the one of the like values or like the value proposition I see, like the app when I used it was like, you're also kind of taking like a photo 
[10:23 - 10:33] or in a way, like, it's cool to look back after you've been somewhere. Like, I know it's like, obviously this one is meant for like Denmark specifically, 
[10:33 - 10:44] but it's also cool to like, just have like a bunch of photos from one place, even if it's, you know, signage, which is still like, kind of, I think it's nice. 
[10:45 - 10:52] Yeah, I think, especially if you, at some point coming back to that place, that could be like a review thing for you or. 
[10:53 - 11:04] Yeah, for sure.  All right. Anything you want to add to that? I don't think so. 
[11:05 - 11:11] Trying to think if I have anything else. Obviously, like, I know, yeah. 
[11:11 - 11:17] Oh, shit. I did it again. It's a, I guess, yeah. 
[11:18 - 11:24] I, it's a prototype. So, but like, if you forget your password. 
[11:25 - 11:32] Oh, yeah, sure.  So, actually, I had to reset the password. Yeah, it's something to be done for sure. 
[11:34 - 11:41] Yeah.  All right. But if you would have to say, do you consider the app to be a learning tool? 
[11:43 - 11:48] Yeah, I think so. And I think, like, the overall, also, like, I don't, I don't know really what I expected from 
[11:48 - 11:58] the get-go. But, like, I think, like, the, I thought the design was nice. Like, when I first got onto it, I guess I would say I was, like, pleasantly surprised 
[11:59 - 12:09] that it, like, I thought it looks nice. And, like, yeah, the logo and typeface and, like, the colors and stuff. 
[12:09 - 12:16] It looks, I guess, better. Not that I don't know, I didn't know your skills or anything. 
[12:16 - 12:24] But it looks better than, like, I expected. Like, it looks, I thought the user interface was nice and also simple with the four menu. 
[12:25 - 12:32] Just, like, the simple menu and stuff. Yeah, I probably spent way more time on it than I should have. 
[12:32 - 12:41] But at least it's nice.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah. And now if you would have to say, can be from one to ten, 
[12:41 - 12:48] how easy was the application to use for you? I guess I would say, like, a nine. 
[12:48 - 12:55] I would only give it minus one because, like, I think I made a couple users because I'm really dumb and forgot the passwords. 
[12:55 - 13:01] All right. And what did you like the most in the app? 
[13:03 - 13:09] I guess, yeah, I think I kind of already touched on it. Like, the thing that I thought was the most valuable as opposed to, 
[13:10 - 13:16] I guess there's, like, the two things.  Like, because when I'm using it, I'm also thinking, like, okay, well, what else exists that's similar? 
[13:16 - 13:21] And, like, why is this good or bad? And then I guess the two things that I thought stuck out is, like, 
[13:21 - 13:31] having the actual, like, photo log is cool because it gives you some sort of sense of place. Or, like, you know, you actually get to see, like, you know, 
[13:31 - 13:36] not just random pictures of, like, an apple and something. And then on Duolingo, be like, what is it? 
[13:36 - 13:45] You know, it's like pictures in Copenhagen.  So that's cool. And then the other was that it's, like, fight-sized lessons, you know? 
[13:45 - 13:51] Or, like, it's mostly, it's obviously, like, vocabulary-based, which is, you know, still a really, like, valuable thing. 
[13:51 - 13:57] But it's cool that it's, I can just do it for a minute if I want. Because I think sometimes, like, with the Duolingo, 
[13:57 - 14:04] especially after I got to a certain point in it, it was just, like, it's rare that I wanted to sit down and complete an entire one. 
[14:04 - 14:15] Or, like, I, you know, sometimes they went on for a long time. So it kind of deters me from doing it in just, like, you know, when I don't have the time. 
[14:15 - 14:21] So with this, it's cool that it's more like you can just do as many or as few words as you want in a single go. 
[14:23 - 14:32] Okay.  And if you would have to say, what do you think is missing? Can be anything, can be a new feature or whatever you think. 
[14:33 - 14:42] Yeah, like, your, like, learned vocabulary, like a tracker that, like, keeps, okay, like, these are the words you know. 
[14:44 - 14:52] Right. Okay.  So we're almost done. The last question is, would you recommend the app to somebody else? 
[14:53 - 15:05] Yeah, I think, like, especially someone who is either just, like, moved to Duolingo, or even just, like, people visiting, I think it's kind of a cool, 
[15:08 - 15:13] it's a cool app. Because, like, and not only does it, like, help them, okay, this is what the sign means. 
[15:14 - 15:20] But it's also, like, a little way of, you know, some people who, even if they're only traveling for a short period of time, 
[15:20 - 15:28] they, like, want to learn the language, at least, you know, on, like, a very surface level. And I think that this app is kind of, like, it's perfect for, like, doing that, 
[15:28 - 15:34] or for assisting, being, like, one of many tools you use to actually, like, be here and learn the language. 
[15:34 - 15:42] But I think it's, like, also really good for just, like, bite-sized, like, learning, or, like, you're coming here, and you just want to know, like, 
[15:42 - 15:49] what some of the street signs mean and stuff.  Yeah, fair. All right. I'm gonna stop recording.
