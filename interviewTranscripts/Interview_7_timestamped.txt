[00:00 - 00:11] So, firstly, we're going to start with some background questions. So what's your occupation, age and nationality? 
[00:11 - 00:25] Okay, so I am a 25 year old cloud engineer, a recent graduate of a computer science master's program and I'm originally Polish. 
[00:25 - 00:35] And what's your level of Danish? None or a bit above none, so I guess that's like module one. 
[00:35 - 00:42] Yeah, I would say probably. And are you attending any Danish classes? 
[00:42 - 00:49] I thought about starting, but not at the moment. And you never did? 
[00:49 - 00:57] No.  Okay. And are you using any mobile apps for learning Danish, except obviously this one? 
[00:57 - 01:05] No, I'm loyal. I tried Duolingo before, but not for a long time. 
[01:05 - 01:17] And do you know why you stopped with Duolingo? Probably two months after starting, but it wasn't like every day. 
[01:18 - 01:31] Okay.  And you were just not motivated to continue using it? Yeah, I guess I just forgot about it or it wasn't engaging enough. 
[01:31 - 01:38] So basically, if I would have to summarize, do you want to learn Danish? If you would have to say that you have the wish to learn? 
[01:38 - 01:45] Yeah, sure. I actually thought about taking it a bit more seriously recently. 
[01:46 - 01:54] Okay. And if you would have to say things that would stop you or obstacles, is there something? 
[01:54 - 01:59] I don't know. I'm just lazy, so I didn't have time to think about it. 
[01:59 - 02:07] But I guess, yeah, I found some new motivation lately. I get that. 
[02:07 - 02:13] I mean, everyone has that, I think. So now a little bit about the app. 
[02:13 - 02:26] So if you would have to say, did you feel motivated to use the app? Yeah, I mean, I felt like I kept forgetting about taking the pictures. 
[02:26 - 02:38] I didn't take that many, but actually the practice part was very engaging. So it still didn't get boring because people add new stuff. 
[02:38 - 02:46] Yeah.  So yeah, it's super nice.  Cool. So you would say that you were using it more for the exercises and not really for the pictures? 
[02:46 - 02:54] Yeah, mostly. I put some pictures, but for that, you need to get out more and also remember to take 
[02:54 - 03:00] the pictures when you're out, right? Because I think it's better when they're outside and put in context of something that you might 
[03:00 - 03:06] actually see around. Yeah, true. 
[03:06 - 03:15] And if you would have to estimate how often were you using it? Was it daily or was it every second day and was it a few minutes or a bit longer? 
[03:15 - 03:26] Yeah, the practice maybe every two days for like, I don't know, in total, maybe like 10, 15 minutes a day. 
[03:26 - 03:32] Not at the same time, but maybe like a couple questions there, a couple there in the bus or something. 
[03:32 - 03:38] And then the pictures, yeah, I took less than 10. So not as many. 
[03:38 - 03:50] Okay.  That's fine. And was there something that was specifically like prompting you to open the app? 
[03:50 - 03:58] Something around you or just your memory? Yeah, probably just the memory. 
[03:58 - 04:11] Whenever I reminded myself that it exists, then I get bored or decided that there's a time to find an alternative to TikTok or after scrolling for an hour, then it was a nice 
[04:11 - 04:17] retreat doing something practical.  So it was nice. Okay. 
[04:17 - 04:30] And I mean, this is a bit similar question, but it's more about, was there something specific that after you started using it, you felt like you want to come back because of that? 
[04:30 - 04:40] So maybe because you got like something felt that you want to continue or you want to do it else. So the milestones at the beginning, like the levels. 
[04:40 - 04:51] So I tried to do that, but then I sort of forgot about it. Yeah, I'm not saying it's the best thing, but if probably if it was like reminding me 
[04:51 - 05:00] with like notifications or something, then maybe I would remember better. But also I guess it's, yeah, it's a balance because some people don't like it. 
[05:00 - 05:11] I also don't like when it's like too much, but Duolingo is pretty aggressive about it. So you would say push notifications, but not too many. 
[05:11 - 05:17] Yeah.  Like one per day or something, or is it also too much? Yeah, good question. 
[05:17 - 05:29] Yeah, maybe a daily one would be all right. And is there something that like apart from what's available in the app, 
[05:29 - 05:35] you think it would engage you more? It can be literally anything. 
[05:35 - 05:42] Like to give you some business ideas on top of that? No, but for example, I can tell you like other people were like, okay, 
[05:42 - 05:53] I didn't like that I had to type the word when I was making it.  Okay. Yeah, I mean, I guess this would make it even easier, but I don't think it was that bad actually, 
[05:53 - 05:59] because you also learn how to type in Danish. So it also sort of ingrains in your memory better. 
[05:59 - 06:06] So I guess it depends from person to person. But I didn't feel like it was too much of a hustle. 
[06:06 - 06:12] It's actually pretty intuitive. Okay. 
[06:12 - 06:18] So not really.  I don't have any recommendations. Okay, fine. 
[06:18 - 06:26] And I mean, you didn't use it for the pictures that much. So probably the answer is no. 
[06:26 - 06:36] But did you feel any different about your surroundings in terms of Danish, of course? As a result of the app? 
[06:36 - 06:42] Yeah. I didn't use it enough to actually think about it that much. 
[06:42 - 06:53] But I guess you could make it a habit.  Like if I... Yeah, it's also about taking pictures of... 
[06:53 - 07:00] If you're in a hurry, it's even easier to forget it. I guess maybe... 
[07:02 - 07:11] If it reminded me in the weekend, then probably I would be taking more pictures. On a day-to-day, it was a bit harder. 
[07:11 - 07:19] Right. Makes sense. But did you feel maybe that it would make you more interested in Danish vocabulary? 
[07:19 - 07:27] Or in learning Danish in general? I mean, I guess you could say that. 
[07:27 - 07:35] I mean, I'm not sure if it's directly related, but I want to start learning Danish. And I started using the app, what was it? Two weeks ago or something. 
[07:35 - 07:43] So maybe there is some correlation.  Okay. But yeah, I guess it's... 
[07:45 - 07:52] People, they put different words. And it wasn't like segregated into easy or hard or like progressing levels. 
[07:52 - 08:02] And that's what I actually didn't like about Duolingo.  That you have to get through all of the basics. And it's more about the way of learning, like structured or non-structured. 
[08:02 - 08:10] Duolingo is a bit more structured about it.  And here you have it like sort of dumped on you. But it's also a nice thing because it's a bit more challenging. 
[08:10 - 08:20] And also the words that you had someone actually pick them out of all of the words in public. And take a picture of that and take the effort. 
[08:22 - 08:33] There were some interesting ones.  Okay.  Okay. So do you have any comments on the upload flow? 
[08:33 - 08:42] So everything from clicking the button to making the picture and writing the translation? It was pretty straightforward. 
[08:42 - 08:48] I didn't have any problems with that.  Great. I think it was all right. 
[08:50 - 08:58] And if you would have to say how easy was the application to use in general? You can say from 1 to 10, for example. 
[09:01 - 09:07] Yeah, I guess 8.  Because at the beginning I couldn't find the other ones. And I had to log in, obviously. 
[09:07 - 09:17] But I couldn't find it. And would you consider this app to be like a somewhat learning tool for you? 
[09:18 - 09:27] Sure.  I think I would be using it.  That's actually what I wanted to mention. I didn't like the structure about Duolingo. 
[09:29 - 09:37] Duolingo actually wants to teach you the language. And holistically to also speak and read and write and do everything all at once. 
[09:37 - 09:45] But if you just want to learn some words, I think this is so much better. And for an actual proper learning of Danish, I would just go to a Danish school. 
[09:45 - 09:54] This is more about getting around the city easier. Yeah, it's actually called microlearning. 
[09:57 - 10:03] Do you hear me?  Yeah, there was some...  It's called microlearning. So you're not supposed to learn the whole thing. 
[10:04 - 10:10] But just like, as you said, have a little bit of something in the back.  Okay. So, yeah, it's a thing. 
[10:10 - 10:18] Okay.  Cool. And okay, so now if you would have to pick, what did you like the most? 
[10:19 - 10:26] You kind of said it already.  Yeah. I mean, I guess the words, the library. 
[10:28 - 10:35] Was it called the library?  It was practice.  Practice.  Yeah, the practice part. But not your pictures, but the pictures of others, right? 
[10:35 - 10:41] Yeah, the pictures of others.  And do you think something is missing? Pictures, but in general. 
[10:42 - 10:59] I think the words, they could be a bit more like, yeah, I'm not sure how I would do that, but it's a, they could be more tricky to pick. Like it was sort of easy at times because one of them would be like, you know, sort of related. 
[10:59 - 11:07] You could sort of guess from the context and the rest would be just like completely out of the, out of the question. So they could be a bit more tricky. 
[11:07 - 11:14] Out of the question. So they could be a bit more harder to answer in a sense of like when it gives you the options. 
[11:14 - 11:21] So that they are a bit more similar to each other or like that you can. Yeah, makes sense. 
[11:21 - 11:27] And the last one is, would you recommend the app to somebody else? For sure I did. 
[11:28 - 11:33] I didn't use it.  Okay, I'll stop the recording.
