[00:00 - 00:09] Okay, so let's start with your occupation, age and nationality. I'm Polish and I'm project manager. 
[00:09 - 00:19] Okay, and what's your level of Danish?  Beginner. And are you attending any Danish classes at the moment? 
[00:19 - 00:25] Not at the moment. At the moment, I used to attend the class a year and a half ago. 
[00:25 - 00:33] And why did you stop? Due to life reasons really, changing of situation in life. 
[00:33 - 00:45] And actually the school after a year of learning didn't provide me with the sufficient level of Danish that I wanted to continue. 
[00:45 - 00:59] So I decided that I actually will try private lessons, but then it never happened. And are you using any mobile apps to learn Danish except that one, of course? 
[00:59 - 01:04] No, I don't.  I never used to learn Danish any app. Okay. 
[01:04 - 01:11] And in general, if you would have to summarize, do you want to learn Danish? Is that your goal in some way? 
[01:11 - 01:23] Yes, definitely.  That's actually something that I would call ambition. But yeah, it is also related to the fact that I have a child who is attending the kindergarten 
[01:23 - 01:33] and all of that.  So it's pretty important.  Right.  Makes sense. So now about the app, did you feel motivated to use the app? 
[01:33 - 01:40] And if yes, why? And if there was something that could motivate you more, maybe you have some ideas? 
[01:41 - 01:51] Yes, I felt motivated, definitely. But due to busyness in my life, I just didn't use it that often. 
[01:51 - 02:00] But I planned, to be honest. But whenever I tried it, and first few days, it was really cool because I really appreciated 
[02:00 - 02:12] the fact that I can make these words out of the context when I pass by shops or products or restaurants or city center. 
[02:12 - 02:18] And then I could really photograph them and even think, oh, what is that sentence and learn it out of it. 
[02:18 - 02:34] And then actually the fact that you have created the option to practice this out of others' content, that was something that's super really seemed to be very interesting, but also kind 
[02:34 - 02:43] of motivating because you kind of want to see, oh, what others see, what I cannot see or like what I didn't spot and so on. 
[02:43 - 02:51] So yeah.  All right. And if you would have to say how much did you use it for photos and how much for the 
[02:51 - 03:01] practice part? I think I've uploaded around six or eight photos, but I also took photos where I could 
[03:01 - 03:10] have more than one interesting sentence or a word and so on. But I did more on the practice, actually. 
[03:10 - 03:19] I was more interesting in that part.  Okay. And if you would have to estimate how often were you using it, was it every second day 
[03:19 - 03:31] and was it just a few minutes or a bit longer? I think it was every second day for around 20 to half an hour. 
[03:31 - 03:39] 20 minutes to half an hour.  Nice. And what was prompting you to open the app? 
[03:39 - 03:49] Oh, because I was about to test it actually, but definitely at some point I felt like I had this interest. 
[03:49 - 03:58] What is there?  What is new there?  What new I can find? What new I can learn and so on. 
[03:58 - 04:04] So if you would have to say, was there like one thing that made you come back the next day? 
[04:04 - 04:13] For example, was it practice? And do you have any idea or suggestion that you know would engage you more daily? 
[04:13 - 04:21] Maybe a reminder or something?  Yeah, exactly.  I was actually thinking about this. You have like kind of a notification. 
[04:21 - 04:32] My husband used to use, I think it's called Babla or something like that, or maybe Duolingo. I don't remember right now, but one of these apps. 
[04:32 - 04:45] And he get that reminder that first of all, you could set a goal and that could be an idea that you set up a goal in the app that you would like to learn, I don't know, five 
[04:45 - 04:54] new words or sentences within the week. And then you could have a reminder that, hey, but maybe not missed your goal because 
[04:54 - 05:04] that is kind of the motivating in the end, but rather something more motivating. There is something new for you, you know, like you, you maybe you want to learn this. 
[05:04 - 05:16] So something like that could be definitely interesting, but definitely what I can say is that something that did motivate me, it was to check again, what new is there? 
[05:16 - 05:22] Because I knew there's some kind of a content that was uploaded by other people. Yeah. 
[05:22 - 05:38] And I really don't have an idea right now what else could be there to build more engagement, but definitely something that, yeah, I think it may be too much, but you could create some 
[05:38 - 05:49] kind of community of people in there that want to learn Danish because right now you have, for instance, I know that there's a lot of Facebook groups when they're share 
[05:49 - 05:58] Danish lessons or practices and it's like, it is closed community. So then you could create it also in the app. 
[05:58 - 06:07] Really good ideas. Now if you would have to say, did you feel any different about your surroundings after 
[06:07 - 06:14] using the app?  Yes, definitely. To be honest, I started to notice more of Danish around me. 
[06:14 - 06:28] Also because I learned, but then I stopped and now I work only in English. The problem is that somehow it disappeared for a while from my area, apart from my daughter 
[06:28 - 06:37] at home, we didn't really have that much of Danish and even at work when I heard it, yes, I heard it, but then it was like a background noise. 
[06:37 - 06:47] And then your app made me kind of realize that I can also learn from the street, from something that is just around me, which is pretty silly to not think about this, but 
[06:47 - 06:53] yeah.  Okay. So actually the next question is, did you feel like the app could make you more interested 
[06:53 - 06:59] in learning Danish again?  So I guess that would be. Yes, exactly. 
[06:59 - 07:06] Definitely.  Okay.  And now like a technical question. Do you have any comments on the upload flow? 
[07:07 - 07:16] So everything from clicking the button to translation and to saving. No, not really. 
[07:16 - 07:25] Nothing really came to my mind when I used this. I think at first I had some issues, but then it was solved. 
[07:25 - 07:36] Because of the flow or something? Because it got stuck for instance, and I needed to return and do this again. 
[07:37 - 07:48] So maybe one idea now I have it actually that for instance, I used three or four times the same photo because it was like a huge sign from a kindergarten. 
[07:48 - 07:58] So I could actually use a lot of text. And then every time I can only place one sentence or one word to translate. 
[07:58 - 08:10] Yes, that would be an idea too. If you could maybe think of going into like when you do the translate, I believe and save, 
[08:10 - 08:17] you still can stay in the same window with the image and maybe you want to provide more. Sounds good. 
[08:17 - 08:27] A really good idea. If you would have to say, is the app a learning tool for you, you would consider it a learning 
[08:27 - 08:33] tool? Yes, I would definitely consider it learning too, but you could think of it as not only 
[08:33 - 08:46] learning too, but also kind of a language engagement. Because if you think about this also only about learning itself, at some point you miss 
[08:46 - 08:54] it.  You start to, you know, it starts to fade away. Like you have a job, you have life, you have family and so on. 
[08:54 - 09:03] But then when there is something that engages you inside the app, then you want to return. So, yeah. 
[09:04 - 09:12] OK, fair.  And was it easy to use the whole application? You can say even from one to ten if you prefer. 
[09:15 - 09:26] Yeah, for me, I think it was around seven, really. At first, I had some kind of learning there that you have library here, you have practice 
[09:26 - 09:33] here. And that was really at the beginning a bit of something to really understand what's the 
[09:33 - 09:40] flow.  But really, I wouldn't say. Yeah, it was rather easy. 
[09:41 - 09:48] OK. And now if you would have to pick one thing, what did you like the most? 
[09:50 - 10:00] I think I like the most practicing from others' content. And if there is something that you think it's missing? 
[10:03 - 10:15] Yeah, I think this kind of a community level when you can maybe share something on the more like I don't want to say Facebook or something like that, but something that where 
[10:15 - 10:21] you know users and you can share something with them. Yeah. 
[10:23 - 10:28] All right. And last question is, would you recommend the app to somebody else? Yes, actually, definitely. 
[10:28 - 10:36] I would. I would. I would. Actually, I already told my few colleagues at work that I tested and they were 
[10:36 - 10:42] like, oh, wow, that's actually something interesting.  So there is that market for it.  Definitely. OK, good to know. 
[10:42 - 10:45] Yeah.  I'm going to stop recording.
