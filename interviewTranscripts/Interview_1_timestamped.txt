[00:00 - 00:20] Let's start with your occupation, age and nationality. My name is Alex, I'm from Slovakia, I'm 24 years old and I work in financial technologies. 
[00:20 - 00:38] And what's your level of Danish? I would say beginner. I have some basics, I can understand the words, but I'm not able to speak fluently or understand a conversation when someone is speaking Danish. 
[00:38 - 00:45] So are you attending any Danish classes? Not right now, but I did some Duolingo in the past. 
[00:45 - 01:04] So the next question is about using mobile apps. You did in the past, but why did you stop? I think I stopped because I didn't have that much time to do it and I also wasn't motivated enough to use the app occasionally. 
[01:04 - 01:21] So once I decided, I lost my streak and then I never started again. So in general, if you would have to say, do you want to learn Danish? Is that a thing you want to do? 
[01:21 - 01:34] Yeah, I definitely want to learn Danish, especially since I'm living in Denmark. And is there something that has been stopping you? I mean, you mentioned time and motivation, so I guess that's the two main things, right? 
[01:34 - 01:43] Yeah, I would agree. Okay, so now we're going to move on to the questions about the app. And we have the first one, which is, did you feel motivated to use the app? 
[01:43 - 02:01] And if there are things that are motivating you, like why was it motivating and what could improve your motivation? Yeah, honestly, I don't think I was feeling motivated that much. I think I needed to find my motivation alone if I was somewhere. 
[02:01 - 02:16] And when I remember that I wanted to translate something, I would just think about the app and try to use it. But something that could increase my motivation to use the app could be a push notification or something like that. 
[02:16 - 02:30] So the app would remind me that I have it on my phone, that I can use it. Okay, sounds good. But what, so would it be like a notification daily or something like that? 
[02:30 - 02:37] Or I'm asking just because I think people are sometimes annoyed with like the amount. So I guess it was like maybe once per day or something. 
[02:37 - 02:47] Yeah, yeah, yeah, precisely. That would work. And so how much did you use the app just for taking photos and how much for the exercises? 
[02:47 - 03:06] Yeah, so I was using the app for taking photos more than for exercises because I only learned that there is exercise section later than while using the app. And I think it also kind of makes sense because I needed to build my library a little bit before starting to practice. 
[03:06 - 03:23] And I also found it a little confusing at the beginning when I opened up the practice section that I saw images that I didn't know or that I didn't take. Since those were images from some other people probably that were using the app. 
[03:24 - 03:47] Okay, so do you have any suggestions for improving the exercises that it would make you use it more? Yeah, I think it would be nice to have a clear differentiation between which section is for practicing my own library and which section is for practicing the library of other people. 
[03:47 - 04:02] Something like a practice with community or something like that. Because I think it was really useful to see some other words that I didn't put into the library to try to guess and get more familiar with those words. 
[04:02 - 04:21] But yeah, on the other hand, I could also only access the practice from my library through library. So maybe if the practice section would be in one tab only, but then would give me two options to either practice with the community or practice my own library. 
[04:21 - 04:37] That would be something I would appreciate. How often were you using it? Was it daily? And for how long? For how many minutes, for example, at once? 
[04:37 - 04:56] Yeah, I wouldn't say that I was using it daily. I would use it like three to four times a week, I think. And the time I spend on the app wasn't that long because I would, as I said previously, I would just take a picture and then translate the word and save it to my library. 
[04:56 - 05:08] Or upload the picture to the app from my library, like from my phone camera. Because that's what I was sometimes doing as well. I think that was a very nice feature to have in the app. 
[05:12 - 05:29] But was there anything that was prompting you to open the app? Like something that you've seen or like, I don't know, like some feeling or was like, as you said before, just something that you knew you wanted to try? Yeah, I think it was more about wanting to try. Yeah. 
[05:30 - 05:43] So it wasn't like, oh, I've seen a Danish word and then you were like, yeah, yeah, I want to try the app. Yeah, that's true. Because Google Translate also has a similar feature that can just translate a word, but I never think about it in that way. 
[05:43 - 05:55] I never just pick up my phone and open Google and then translate the word that I'm seeing via Google. I think the other thing is that you can build this own library, right? So that's the... 
[05:56 - 06:21] Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's another thing. I think it would be more useful because I feel like that is the nicest thing about the app, that you can build your own library and you can just save all the words that you're kind of learning. And Google Translate kind of has the same function because you can start your translations. But I feel like it should auto, like your app should auto save everything that we put inside. 
[06:22 - 06:32] So that save and add to your library button was kind of redundant. So it's not really needed. Oh, you mean so once it's translated, it's already been saved? 
[06:32 - 06:57] Yeah, it saves automatically. Yeah. Because then I also experienced some bugs with that add and save button. So I would click on it and it would load for a long time and then the app would crash or I would need to cancel the app. So you would think that the best way would be to once you click translate, it's showing you the translation but automatically also saving it to your library? 
[06:57 - 07:16] Yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And now, was there something in the app that made you like particularly interested in coming back to it? I think you kind of already said with the own library, but maybe if you have some more ideas, what would engage you more into using it? 
[07:17 - 07:42] Yeah, I like the level section that you saw how many more words you need to learn in order to get into the next level. And this like a progress section to see how you're doing. And maybe there was also some quiz sections. So when you're doing the practice, you would see a little bit more information or like data about your performance. And the exercises. 
[07:42 - 07:52] Yeah. Right. And would you say you feel any different about your surroundings after using the app? 
[07:52 - 07:59] Yeah, I definitely notice Danish words that are written way more than I did in the past. Nice. 
[07:59 - 08:16] Also different signs, like in public areas, for example. Really cool. And so I guess that's kind of same question. But do you feel like the app made you more interested in Danish vocabulary and potentially more interested in learning it? 
[08:16 - 08:35] Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I would definitely say so.  Okay. Okay, this I'm just going to say it again, even though we talked a little bit, but you said that the images uploaded by others were relevant to you, right? But you weren't sure at the beginning, what is it about? 
[08:36 - 08:57] Yeah, I think it was good to see those images. But then I also realized that people are probably seeing my images too. And I don't think I ever gave a consent for that. So I think that's something that could be considered as well from the legal perspective or something like that, that you are sharing images of other people as well within the app. 
[08:57 - 09:05] So you could maybe even have an option to share or if you don't want to, you can keep it.  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, very good feedback. Okay. 
[09:06 - 09:13] And maybe even like add the images of other people into your own library after you practice them. Like add to your favorites or something. 
[09:13 - 09:38] Yeah. And then when we're talking about the library, I think it will be also useful to be able to categorize the words or at least like open up the word because when I access my library, I can only see list of the words that I learned and the image that I took. I think it would be nice to just open up the word and see maybe a definition, but that would be a little bit too much maybe already. 
[09:39 - 10:01] But yeah, that would be probably like a few releases further. But also seeing the word used in a sentence or being able to play the pronunciation of the word because that is one of the hardest things for me, especially in Danish, the pronunciation. 
[10:01 - 10:08] And if I could listen to the word that I learned and like practice it, that would be useful. That's really good idea. 
[10:10 - 10:19] Okay. So now like more technical questions. Do you have any comments on the upload flow? So everything from clicking the button to making a picture to saving it. 
[10:19 - 10:28] I know you said a little bit already about that. Yeah. I would say that the home section wasn't very intuitive. 
[10:29 - 10:51] I would maybe prefer if it was easier for me to take the picture altogether or maybe adjusting the bottom footer or like the panel on the bottom bit like a home section. So the take picture part should be in the middle and more emphasized kind of. 
[10:53 - 11:03] You mean like the title of it and also the placement of the... Yeah. The placement. So I would keep the bottom menu control with three panels only. 
[11:03 - 11:15] So the home would be in the middle or in the middle most probably. Library on the left and then practice on the right because then it would make me more wanting to practice if it's on the right. 
[11:15 - 11:27] Because right now there was the logout section on the right. And I think it was really easy especially for me as a person who uses their phone in their right hand to just click into that corner and log out. 
[11:28 - 11:39] This is where everyone said that this was a problem. So would you say I guess also then we would have a profile right and then instead of logging out you click on profile and see your data. 
[11:39 - 11:49] Yeah.  Okay.  For example. Yeah. Cool. And would you say you consider the app to be like somewhat a learning tool for you. 
[11:50 - 12:08] Yeah definitely. It totally made me think about learning language differently. I think it is a good idea to learn language from images especially me being a person who learns the best when seeing something written. 
[12:09 - 12:36] So yeah. The only thing that I found a little frustrating was that I always needed to type the word. If the app recognized the word and pasted a text in it already that would be very beneficial because I found it useful to take the picture and then type it as well when I could only type it. 
[12:36 - 12:45] Makes sense. All right. And now how was how easy was the application to use in general. 
[12:45 - 12:53] You can say maybe from one to ten even.  I would say six. I think it still needs some improvements. 
[12:54 - 13:08] Also placement of some small features for example when I opened the camera there was a little camera emoji and the flash emoji. Both of them were on the left side. I think it would be more useful to have them on the right side. 
[13:08 - 13:19] And I it also wasn't completely clear to me what those emojis are for. After clicking on them I realized that they're just like placeholders for a camera and flash. 
[13:19 - 13:40] But at the same time I feel like there is already a standardized image of a flash and then a camera that is used across other apps such as Instagram or whatever else. So it would be good to use those standardized images within the app to make it clear for the user what they're used for. 
[13:41 - 13:47] Yeah. So what did you like the most in the app. I think it was the library. 
[13:47 - 14:05] The fact that I could see how many words I learned and see them all in one place and also see the image next to the next student. That would remind me where I saw them and in what situations I took the picture. 
[14:06 - 14:15] Cool. And what do you think is missing. I know you said a lot of things but maybe like main thing that comes to your mind that's missing right now. 
[14:15 - 14:44] I don't know if it's something that it's missing but I think that the app should be a little bit more intuitive and user friendly because in that case it would be more motivating for me to use it because it's all about the practice and all about using the app. Good point. Okay. And now the last question. Would you advise the app to somebody else. 
[14:45 - 14:57] I would recommend the app. Yeah. If it was optimized and if the features that I mentioned would be there I would definitely advise people to use it. 
[14:58 - 15:02] Cool. That's it. Thank you.  Let's just save it.
