[00:00 - 00:10] Right, so let's start with introduction. So your occupation, age and nationality. So I'm 26 and nationality is Slovak. 
[00:10 - 00:17] And what do you do? I work as a cleaner for Sheston for HelloFresh. 
[00:17 - 00:23] Okay.  Yes. So what's your level of Danish? 
[00:24 - 00:34] So I've been taking classes and I finished the first module. So that means, I don't know if there is any letter to it. 
[00:34 - 00:41] But yeah, so not really far, but I know some basics. And you were attending Danish classes. 
[00:41 - 00:50] So why did you stop? I started during Corona, which made it more difficult to do it online. 
[00:51 - 01:00] And I think I wasn't that motivated at the end of the module to continue. Because there was still Corona, I was like, I don't want to take the classes during lockdown. 
[01:00 - 01:07] That was actually the reason. And then the time passes and never get back to it. But actually, probably I'll turn up again. 
[01:07 - 01:15] Okay.  But are you using any mobile apps right now for learning Danish? Of course, except the one you're talking about. 
[01:15 - 01:24] Not currently, no. But I was actively using Duolingo. I had a strike for almost 150 days. 
[01:24 - 01:33] So I think that's maybe something to note.  And why did you stop? Because I lost the strike and then I stopped. 
[01:33 - 01:41] The motivation wasn't high enough, I would say. And then also Duolingo has a real weird system of learning sometimes. 
[01:41 - 01:50] You don't find something as useful as you would like to. The words you use, they use it. 
[01:50 - 01:57] Okay, but in general, if you have to say, do you want to learn Danish? I would say yes. 
[01:57 - 02:03] And the things that are kind of stopping you is the motivation? I would say so. 
[02:03 - 02:11] I think it's also something to do that I don't really need Danish that much in my life. Because at work we all speak English. 
[02:11 - 02:20] And if there is something that requires Danish, there are people around me who speak Danish. And take over the task that needs to be done. 
[02:20 - 02:27] And I also don't have that many friends who would be Danish. And if I do, then they also speak English. 
[02:27 - 02:34] And I think that's the reason.  Okay. We're going to move on to the questions about the apps. 
[02:34 - 02:44] So did you feel motivated to use the app?  And if yes, what was motivating you? And if no, do you have any improvement ideas that would make you more motivated? 
[02:44 - 02:54] So I don't know.  I would say maybe not that much. Because I felt like it was somewhat similar to the translator. 
[02:54 - 03:03] Like the regular Google translator. As you had to write down the sentence or word you wanted to translate. 
[03:03 - 03:11] And then it was kind of like a long process. If you're doing something in between and you need to stop, open the app and rewrite everything you're doing. 
[03:11 - 03:19] You wanted to translate.  So I think that was partially the reason. That I found other apps more convenient to do it. 
[03:19 - 03:25] If I want to translate something. Instead of taking the picture, writing it down and then having it translated. 
[03:25 - 03:31] And maybe some notifications. If I would be reminded of. 
[03:31 - 03:38] Because sometimes I understand words or sentences.  And I don't need to translate them. But it would be good to maybe know the exact translation. 
[03:38 - 03:48] If I would have a notification letting me know that I should do it.  I would probably do it more. So you're not really interested in the fact that you can save those translators. 
[03:48 - 03:55] And build a library.  Because you feel more like, okay, I can translate with Google. And I don't care what happens later to this. 
[03:55 - 04:02] Yeah, because there is no later.  Because I can save it for sure. But I will not come back to it and look at the pictures. 
[04:02 - 04:08] Maybe there will be some engagement with that.  Like, oh, I learned this. So let's practice again. 
[04:08 - 04:14] Let's try to remember the words properly or something like that.  But you can practice. You know that? No. 
[04:14 - 04:20] Okay.  No, okay. That's good.  So you never went that far. No. 
[04:20 - 04:27] So now the question is how much did you use it for taking photos.  And how much for the exercises? So exercises, zero. 
[04:27 - 04:33] And taking photos, I think I used it. I would say for four-ish days. 
[04:33 - 04:40] Like trying to remember.  And then I just kept forgetting more and more. So was it like you just took photos, saved it, and that's it? 
[04:40 - 04:49] Yes.  And I think there will be more questions about it. But when I went to use it, it was taking – I know it's no one's fault here. 
[04:49 - 04:55] But it was taking a bit too long.  Like the process is on its own. And sometimes you don't want to save. 
[04:55 - 05:01] So I had to retake the picture. I was spending a lot of time on something so small. 
[05:01 - 05:08] Yeah.  So now the question about how often were you using it. So you said four days. 
[05:08 - 05:15] And if you would say how long was it, it was just a few minutes? I would say a few minutes. 
[05:15 - 05:25] Like when I see a word somewhere or a sentence at the store or here at home, which I would find interesting to translate, I would do that. 
[05:25 - 05:37] But it wasn't like, oh, I have this app and I kind of want to use it. But more like, oh, I'm interested to know how well it works or no. 
[05:37 - 05:43] Okay. So that's kind of connected because now I'm going to ask you what was prompting you to open the app. 
[05:43 - 05:49] So it was like the Danish word that you see.  Yeah.  And also you wanted to try because I asked you. Yeah, exactly. 
[05:49 - 05:55] That's what you needed.  Yeah.  It was like – yeah.  I think that's basically the answer. I think that's the answer to it. 
[05:55 - 06:02] Mm-hmm. So I would call it curiosity rather than anything else, right? 
[06:02 - 06:12] Yes.  Mm-hmm. But was there something in particular that made you come back to it the next day? 
[06:12 - 06:20] Can be anything like you were thinking, oh, like maybe today I can learn some words or – you know what I mean? Yeah, I would say – 
[06:21 - 06:29] Like elements.  Yeah.  Thank you. I think the idea behind it is interesting. 
[06:29 - 06:38] I just feel that every time I open the app, I feel discouraged by how long it was taking. And I feel like I'm a person who is really impatient. 
[06:38 - 06:49] So I would say that was the main reason like when I had like issues with openings. I'm like, oh, it's going to take for us all like too long to do everything there. 
[06:49 - 06:56] Okay, so the question is now like what would engage you more? But you mean long-taking as in because it was taking so long to say? 
[06:56 - 07:06] Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  Or also the writing the word?  Yeah, the writing the word. I would say everything, yeah, because I would say these two facts combined makes me not use an app. 
[07:06 - 07:21] Like in any other sense, not only about the English, but I would say overall there is added – has these two issues, I'm like, no, thanks. So if you would have to summarize what would engage you more, would it be like it would be faster? 
[07:21 - 07:33] Yes, I would say I don't know what could be the solution to like not write it down. Because I feel like it's a good practice to write it down because you didn't learn the word, but maybe have it translated. 
[07:33 - 07:42] But then to come back to it to be able to practice, you would have to write it down again, for example, or something like that. So I would say that. 
[07:42 - 07:50] Because I feel like that it was taking too long to add, to load. It's not really something that is an issue on its own. 
[07:50 - 07:56] It's not about the app, but yeah, so I would say that the other thing. So it would be like an automatically recognizing the text? 
[07:56 - 08:04] Yeah, I would say, yeah. Okay, but did you feel any different about your surroundings after using the app? 
[08:06 - 08:13] More about like the surroundings connected to Danish, obviously. I would say no. 
[08:16 - 08:27] And did you feel like the app made you more interested in Danish vocabulary or like potentially in learning it? Not even through the app, but like in general. 
[08:27 - 08:36] I would say yes. I felt like I had like a revoke this like need to learn the Danish again. 
[08:37 - 08:46] So definitely.  I actually set up for Danish, but that's not about.  Maybe for later. So definitely. 
[08:46 - 08:56] Okay.  Sorry, I got lost.  Yeah, no worries. So did you find the pictures uploaded by others relevant? 
[08:56 - 09:02] So that's the exercise part.  Well, I know about it because I've seen Tobi doing it. And I think yes. 
[09:02 - 09:13] I feel like when it comes to this kind of apps, it's important to have this kind of engagement, like to see other people doing it. So you feel encouraged to use it more. 
[09:13 - 09:22] And yeah, as I said before, I think it will be some kind of game or practice, even with those other words. It could be really fun. 
[09:22 - 09:31] Like to see how it works.  Yeah, exactly. And do you have this more technical, but you already touched upon that. 
[09:31 - 09:42] But do you have comments on the upload flow to anything from clicking to take the picture to writing the word and saving it? I know it's too slow, but maybe you have some comments on that. 
[09:42 - 09:51] Yeah, I think it's a good idea to have a little bit of a practice. So anything from clicking to take the picture to writing the word and saving it. 
[09:51 - 09:57] I know it's too slow, but maybe you have some other usability comments. Can I open the app? 
[09:57 - 10:04] You can. I had a comment, which I know I wrote down before, but I don't remember anymore. 
[10:04 - 10:11] But there was something I said about, but I think it's more. You were saying about the logout. 
[10:11 - 10:22] Yes.  That's not the app.  That's not the app, yeah. No, I don't think there wasn't any issue. 
[10:22 - 10:32] I know that sometimes the upload was like the camera got really long. I don't know what error that was. 
[10:32 - 10:38] I don't know about that.  Yeah, the image was like this. Stretched. 
[10:38 - 10:46] Yeah, stretched. Yeah, that actually I don't think so. 
[10:47 - 10:55] Okay, that's fine. And the next question is, do you consider it to be like a someone learning tool? 
[10:56 - 11:03] Yeah, I would say yes. Definitely with the engagement with other people, like seeing the images. 
[11:03 - 11:11] And yeah. And if you would have to say how easy it was to use, you can say even from one to ten. 
[11:11 - 11:22] Like in general, the whole application. Do you mean like more the idea or like the way everything is distributed on the app? 
[11:22 - 11:33] Like if you would have to say like, you know, if sometimes you have an app and you say, well, it's so easy to use, you immediately know what to do. Yeah, I would say six. 
[11:34 - 11:49] Like for sure, there's some stuff that could be improved, but I don't think for the demo version it was better or anything. So what did you like the most about it? 
[11:52 - 12:01] I'm like kind of confused what to say. Which functionality? Because like, I mean, you didn't use the exercise, but like usually exercise, but maybe taking the pictures. 
[12:01 - 12:11] So like which one of those would be your favorite thing? I would say that for sure that it gets saved, like you have it in the library because then you can back to it. 
[12:11 - 12:21] And as I think we just scroll back to the same thing that you can come back to it. And if you could use it, someone else, the words that you used, you saved, that would be nice. 
[12:22 - 12:34] I don't know. I think it's pretty straightforward and easy to use. There is nothing complicated about it, which I think that's also important because I don't like apps that have so many different options. 
[12:34 - 12:40] And you have to move around to even find what you're looking for. So I think, yeah, I think that's good. 
[12:40 - 12:52] So I like the colors too. That's not important, but I think they're well chosen. But so you said it's straightforward to use, but you say it was six out of ten in easiness. 
[12:52 - 13:06] And is it because of the slowness or what's the like? I think I mean, as I said, I think I would say that if something needs to be specific, I would say that the logout thing annoyed me a lot because I kept clicking on it. 
[13:06 - 13:20] And because I feel like it would be easier to keep just the profile and the logout and the other way, like to do the other way around. So you just click there and you see, oh, maybe I could look out, but then you just look out automatically, which is annoying. 
[13:20 - 13:33] Then it just takes longer to log in and then use it and go back to the same thing again. So, yeah, and now I'm locked out and I'm not. I cannot log in. 
[13:34 - 13:41] Okay. The last two questions.  Yes. So if you have to say what do you think is missing? 
[13:42 - 13:49] The notifications for sure. That's I think I said it before. 
[13:49 - 13:59] And also, yeah, to use the words that I saved more like to have the game or some kind of daily practice. From your words. 
[13:59 - 14:14] Yes. Or maybe it could elevate later or have like more different ones that you could like practice with the words from other people and your own words to see if the words you are saving are actually useful to you. 
[14:14 - 14:27] Or there are just some random words that you don't need in your everyday life. They were just something very specific or actually, you know, I think that we have to find like the way to kind of distinguish which one are the words that you're. 
[14:27 - 14:36] Oh, I had to train it because it's really difficult word or something that's like more like, oh, this word is important to me because I've seen it so many times in the day. So I would like to like finally remember it. 
[14:36 - 14:46] So like categorize.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah. Okay. And about notification, like what do you say, like daily notification once per day? 
[14:46 - 14:56] Because I know people are also annoyed with notifications.  So what would be like perfect one for you? Well, maybe I would do it about the frequency. 
[14:56 - 15:05] I really don't know. I would say one per day if it's a user like I use from the date and it's fine if it's a bad news every day and I have notifications annoying. 
[15:05 - 15:13] I know there is like the reason that you can like actually said like after some time people don't use it. They will not no longer have the notifications. 
[15:13 - 15:19] So I don't know. But I would say it would be nice to have notifications with the specific words, for example. 
[15:19 - 15:25] So it wouldn't be like, hey, come back.  But maybe like, oh, remember this word? Open the app and something like that. 
[15:25 - 15:32] Nice.  Okay.  Yeah. So the last question is, would you recommend the app to somebody else? 
[15:34 - 15:45] Yeah, if we have the improvements I said and definitely because I feel like it would make sense. Cool. 
[15:45 - 15:51] Yes, that's it.  Okay.  I mean, do you have anything to say if you have more feedback? We can. 
[15:51 - 15:54] Well, I mean, no.  Okay.  Thank you.
