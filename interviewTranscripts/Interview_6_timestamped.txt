[00:00 - 00:14] So we're going to start with a little bit of background questions, even though maybe I know some of them is just for the paper. What's your occupation, age and nationality? 
[00:14 - 00:29] So occupation is product designer, actually senior product designer as of recently. And then age is 28, I'm like almost 29 now. 
[00:29 - 00:35] And nationality is Spanish. Okay, and what's your level of Danish? 
[00:35 - 00:44] Medium low, I would say. But are you attending any classes right now? 
[00:44 - 00:54] Not right now. No, I've attended classes, but not right now. And so why did you stop attending the classes in the past? 
[00:54 - 01:07] To be honest, when I was in the middle of the studies, it was COVID. So then they cancelled the classes for a while and then we went back, but it was online classes. 
[01:07 - 01:13] And I really didn't like online classes.  I felt like it was not the same. And I kind of stopped it. 
[01:13 - 01:22] And I never picked it back.  Yeah. Do you remember which module did you stop? 
[01:22 - 01:30] I was starting module three.  Three, okay.  Yeah. Are you using any apps to learn Danish? 
[01:30 - 01:37] Not now. I was using Duolingo for some time. And why did you stop with Duolingo? 
[01:38 - 01:53] I don't know. I think it comes back to the, like, my focus on learning Danish kind of like switched, like, yeah, I don't know. 
[01:53 - 02:02] And with Duolingo, I felt like, I mean, it was a good help. But I don't know. 
[02:02 - 02:14] It was not like I was super engaged or something like that. So it was both the app, but also your personal motivation. 
[02:14 - 02:20] Yes. But if you would have to say now, do you want to learn Danish? 
[02:20 - 02:30] Or is it for now not really in your... I mean, the thing is, I always want to learn Danish because it will make things easier. 
[02:30 - 02:38] But it's so hard that I don't have the motivation, I feel, to commit 100%. But I would like to learn Danish, yes. 
[02:40 - 02:48] Okay.  So now we can move on to the question about the app. And the first one is, did you feel motivated to use the app? 
[02:49 - 02:57] I mean, at the beginning, yes. But I must say that it's been a bit like hard to remember to take pictures. 
[02:57 - 03:14] But like, especially the practice thing, I ended up using that more than taking the pictures. Do you have any, like, ideas what would make you more motivated? 
[03:15 - 03:27] Like, for example, make you remember to take the pictures and so on? I mean, make me remember might be through notifications. 
[03:28 - 03:37] But that's always tricky because notifications can be annoying. So, yeah, I don't know. Maybe that could be a way. 
[03:38 - 03:44] And then, yeah, I don't know.  I think...  Yeah. No, I think it will be more down to me. 
[03:44 - 03:52] Like, I will need to find the motivation. But when it comes to notifications, you said that it's annoying. 
[03:52 - 04:00] And I feel like a lot of people have that.  Yeah. Is there like a limit or amount of notification that you feel like, okay, it's fair. 
[04:00 - 04:08] And then you're not getting really annoyed, like daily or once in a while? Because I know for example Duolingo and these other apps, 
[04:09 - 04:17] they're really sending a lot of notifications, which I also don't like.  Yeah. Yeah. They really drilled you and kind of put you to shame sometimes. 
[04:20 - 04:32] I don't know. I think like a plain notification, like, I don't know. I don't know what it could be, but maybe a reminder that you added some words last week or something like that. 
[04:34 - 04:41] Just, yeah, something very plain.  So if you feel motivated, then you open the app and you do something about it. If not, you can just like skip it. 
[04:44 - 04:53] Sounds good. Now you kind of answered that a bit, but how much did you use it for actually taking photos and how much for the exercises? 
[04:53 - 05:01] So it was more for the exercises, right? Yeah, I would say like probably like 70% exercises, 30% taking pictures. 
[05:02 - 05:11] All right. And how often were you using it? So was it daily or every second day? Was it a few minutes or a bit more? 
[05:12 - 05:19] So it was not daily. I mean, I think it could have been daily, but again, I sometimes forgot. 
[05:19 - 05:35] But I will say you always encounter some word that, yeah. But like, for example, I will say that sometimes, like in my use case, like sometimes there is like a long text of Danish that I don't understand. 
[05:35 - 05:49] And then I use Google Translate. Right.  So in this case, it's more for like a specific word or something like that. But then, yeah, for use case, I don't know, like I would say maybe every other day, not on a constant, but yeah. 
[05:50 - 06:03] And what was prompting you to open the app? Was there something that you just remembered or you like seen a Danish word and then you were like, yeah, you wanted to practice? 
[06:03 - 06:17] Was there something specific there? Yeah, it was like I will say mostly it was just like seeing a word and like it was more like that, you know, like a specific word or maybe like a couple of words in something around me that I didn't get. 
[06:18 - 06:29] And then it was easy to just check it with that. Because, yeah, again, if it was like more on the computer with long text, then Google Translate will do the trick. Right. 
[06:31 - 06:49] And was there something that was like particularly interested to you that made you think like, OK, I want to come back to this app. And is there something I mean, we talked a little bit about engagement, but something that would engage you more within the app. 
[06:49 - 07:07] So maybe something else in the practice part or can be anything. Yeah, I mean, again, I think the practice part was the most engaging because maybe myself, I didn't find that many words around me or something that I wanted to take pictures of. 
[07:07 - 07:19] But like I found myself sometimes going in the app and then checking the practice and then just going through what I'm guessing is other people's pictures. And then, yeah, that was pretty cool. 
[07:20 - 07:31] The only thing that was a bit funky was I tried. So you have your library of pictures and then you can go into practice mode of your library. 
[07:32 - 07:51] And that was a bit funky because the options offered like you can choose between four options and from the options offered, it was mostly like three. It was the same or a couple was the same and then only one was like different than the rest. 
[07:52 - 08:00] It's a bug. But I. But yeah, it's not. I think it would only work once you have the library. 
[08:00 - 08:13] But obviously, do something before if you don't have the library. Yes, thank you. And did you feel any different about your surroundings after using the app? 
[08:14 - 08:36] I mean, not really, but probably a bit more aware of like when a word seems like new or maybe also sometimes like a word that I feel like I should know, but I cannot really put it like, OK, what is this? And then, yeah, you just have it. 
[08:36 - 08:42] Are you are more conscious about like, OK, I don't know this word.  I need to check it.  Right. OK, so like a little bit, maybe. Yeah. 
[08:44 - 08:54] And did you feel that you got more interested in Danish vocabulary or potentially like learning it again? Like was it like a motivating push, basically? 
[08:55 - 09:04] That's again a tricky one to answer. Like, yes, because every time I'm learning something about Danish, I get a reminder of I should learn Danish. 
[09:05 - 09:11] But that doesn't make me do it, though. So I don't know. It's a bit in between. 
[09:12 - 09:21] OK.  Yeah, I guess this is. Yeah, you did find the images uploaded by others relevant, right? 
[09:21 - 09:29] The social aspect of it.  You mentioned that it was very nice to see.  Yes. So now, like more technical questions. 
[09:29 - 09:39] Do you have any comments on the upload flow, like from making the picture to translating it to saving it? Can be anything can be design wise or functionality wise. 
[09:42 - 09:49] I don't know if I have any specifics. Or the uploading. 
[09:51 - 09:57] I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. Or the uploading. 
[09:58 - 10:05] I mean, it's pretty straightforward.  Like the button is huge. So it's pretty easy to understand what you're supposed to. 
[10:07 - 10:17] I think once it got a bit buggy, but I think it was just like, I don't know, like it probably slowly loading or something like that. So, yeah, I don't know. 
[10:17 - 10:27] I don't have any specifics, I would say.  That's fine.  Totally. And would you say that it is like somewhat learning tool? 
[10:27 - 10:38] Would you consider that a learning tool?  Yeah. I mean, I would say I would say you cannot just learn the English with this, right? 
[10:38 - 10:45] Like it's a tool that can help you.  So, yeah. OK. 
[10:45 - 10:53] And if you would have to say like maybe even from one to ten, how easy was the application to use for you? It's pretty easy. 
[10:53 - 10:59] So I will say like, yeah, like eight, nine, something like that.  Nice. Something positive. 
[11:01 - 11:07] And what did you like the most? Again, I think the library. 
[11:07 - 11:16] It was pretty cool. And, you know, it's funny to see what other people find in the street like, oh, I don't know this. 
[11:17 - 11:23] I think that was cool.  Can I give feedback on one thing that I didn't really? Yeah. 
[11:23 - 11:41] So in the library, you have to toggle to see the translations. Is that like for some reason or just I found myself like more than like usually wanting to see the translations right away than hiding them. 
[11:41 - 11:47] But I'm guessing it's probably because of the practice. That was the thought. 
[11:47 - 12:04] But obviously, it's an idea.  So it's up for discussion. Like my idea was that if you want to practice that library and if you already enter and see it and then you practice it, you know, like you will maybe remember what you've just seen. 
[12:06 - 12:21] But I guess I got some other feedback on the practice, your library not being really clear. So I guess to solve that would be to actually keep the translation open and move the practice, your library to the main practice where you can just choose. 
[12:21 - 12:28] Are you practicing all or your words?  Yeah, that will make sense.  Yeah. You can like switch between one another. 
[12:28 - 12:34] Yeah.  Because it's true that I actually took some time to find the practice, your library. I didn't. 
[12:34 - 12:40] Yeah.  And you would prefer to see the translation straight away.  I think so. Yeah. 
[12:40 - 12:47] Because like when I was going to the library, I was like, oh, what was this word?  And then I had to toggle it.  And it was a bit. Okay. 
[12:49 - 12:56] Two last questions.  So if you would say what do you think is missing? I mean, you mentioned the push notifications and the toggle. 
[12:56 - 13:05] But is there anything else that you think could make it better? I don't know. 
[13:06 - 13:22] It's hard to think about. I mean, I saw that there is the levels. 
[13:24 - 13:32] Yeah.  So I guess that's the gamification part of it. It's not something like I'm guessing could be. 
[13:33 - 13:42] Like you get hooked into it.  But maybe something about the practice having some gamification in it. Yeah. 
[13:42 - 13:49] I think maybe that could be cool.  Okay. And the last one is, would you advise the app or like recommend the app to 
[13:49 - 13:58] somebody else?  Yeah. I think, again, as a tool to a person that is learning, I think it's 
[13:59 - 14:05] cool.  Again, I don't think you can learn, fully learn a language just through an app. 
[14:05 - 14:13] And I don't think that's the purpose of this.  But, yeah, I think it's a good way. Because it also helps you when you're in different contexts. 
[14:13 - 14:21] Like you are not necessarily trying to learn English.  But then you see a picture. Or not a picture, but you just see a word somewhere. 
[14:21 - 14:27] And it's like, well, what is that?  Or that's a cool word.  Yeah. It's a good tool for that. 
[14:27 - 14:35] Yeah.  I feel like because actually the research is about microlearning. So as you said, it's not really like you're not going to learn 
[14:35 - 14:41] conversation in Danish. But it's like a microlearning tool that is helping you a little bit to 
[14:41 - 14:48] get into that.  Yeah.  Yeah. And I think usually like you see a word and, okay, you can technically 
[14:48 - 14:56] go and you can just go and you can just go and you can just go and you can, okay, you can technically go and go Google and translate or 
[14:56 - 15:02] whatever.  But I don't know. I think the idea of having a picture of it also helps you in the 
[15:02 - 15:10] future, right?  So.  Yeah.  Yeah. Like it's about having your own library kind of made up of words. 
[15:10 - 15:18] So, yeah.  So I don't, yeah.  But you're right. And, yeah, unless you want to say something else, I will stop 
[15:18 - 15:23] recording.  That's good.  Yeah.  Okay.
