[00:00 - 00:07] next week, I don't know.  Huh?  Oh yeah, that's also fine. Let's just record. 
[00:07 - 00:13] So let's start again, okay?  Sorry.  From the beginning again? Yep. 
[00:14 - 00:22] What's the problem?  Yeah, yeah.  Sounds good. So please, one more time, your occupation, age and nationality? 
[00:25 - 00:32] German, 25.  What's occupation? Working student. 
[00:32 - 00:40] Okay, level of Danish?  Zero, basic. And are you attending Danish classes? 
[00:40 - 00:48] No.  And are you using some mobile apps to learn Danish? Neither am I. 
[00:49 - 00:56] And do you wish to learn Danish?  A little bit. And is there something that's stopping you? 
[01:01 - 01:08] Um... Motivation. 
[01:10 - 01:18] Motivation.  Okay. So, did you feel motivated to use the app? 
[01:19 - 01:25] Yes.  Why?  What was motivating you? The level. 
[01:26 - 01:32] You can achieve a higher level.  That's so funny. So the gamification aspect was motivating. 
[01:34 - 01:44] And do you have improvement ideas of what could motivate you more? Notifications on maybe daily basis. 
[01:45 - 01:55] And achieving strike series.  Okay. So how much did you use the app for like taking photos and how much for the exercises? 
[01:59 - 02:07] Photos... It depends what you take for it because I was going on a walk just to take photos. 
[02:07 - 02:13] This was already like one hour.  One session. Mostly photos. 
[02:17 - 02:26] Just the clicking or what?  No, the question is...  Because the app was... Tobi, no one had questions about those questions. 
[02:26 - 02:35] You're the only person.  It's always like that, I know. So were you doing the actual pictures or were you doing the exercises? 
[02:36 - 02:44] I was doing both. Yes, but if you have to say like for example 40% pictures and 60% exercises. 
[02:45 - 02:54] Oh. Maybe... 
[02:57 - 03:03] 30% and 70%. So 30% pictures and 70% exercises. 
[03:04 - 03:13] Exactly.  Okay. And how often were you using it? Like daily and for how long? 
[03:16 - 03:24] Every second day.  Okay.  How long... Hmm. 
[03:26 - 03:33] 10 to 15 minutes.  Every second day 10 to 15 minutes. Mm-hmm. 
[03:35 - 03:43] Yeah. And what was prompting you to open the app to actually start using it? 
[03:45 - 03:53] Prompting?  Yeah, like making you start using it.  Like what was... What happened that all of a sudden you opened the app? 
[03:55 - 04:03] I mean at the beginning Curiosity.  Okay.  Because it's a new app. That's it? 
[04:06 - 04:13] And I need to learn a little bit.  Like curious how much I could learn with how much effort. And how much... 
[04:13 - 04:20] I mean, yeah, Curiosity at the end of the day.  How much fun is it to use it and is there some progress? Am I observing progress? 
[04:21 - 04:29] Is it worth to use it then? Okay, but once you used it for like once or twice, I guess you knew what it was already. 
[04:29 - 04:35] So there was no Curiosity.  I mean, the Curiosity was then in how much you can learn. Correct? 
[04:35 - 04:41] Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  But was there something... It was worth the effort. 
[04:42 - 04:49] Okay, I get it.  But was there something like particularly... Particular that made you come back the next day? 
[04:50 - 05:05] That you found interesting and then you wanted to use it again? If I found a really nice sign or something, then I would say, oh yeah, this is something for the app. 
[05:05 - 05:13] I mean, I was going to something, the exercise with automating photos. So the photos were the main thing and then you... 
[05:14 - 05:28] Like you were prompted and make the photo and then you make the exercises. Yeah, I'm not straight direct up, but like when I'm back home. 
[05:28 - 05:35] So like, but it's kind of a chain. Like first to make the photo, then we go home and then I want to check them. 
[05:36 - 05:42] Okay.  And make more exercise. But I'm not waking up and starting the exercise. 
[05:43 - 05:49] Okay.  But do you think there's something... I think because it's the fun part of new things. 
[05:50 - 05:56] Okay.  But do you think there is something that could engage you more? Or like, what do you think could engage you more? 
[05:57 - 06:04] Strike series?  It's a reminder. And then you can maybe set your own reminder time. 
[06:04 - 06:10] So like at eight in the morning, I want to have a reminder to make it. Because it needs some time to build a habit for everyone. 
[06:10 - 06:18] I think.  At some point, maybe you don't need to remind anymore, but it's for sure. Or let's say I want to do it at nine. 
[06:20 - 06:29] So I want to have my reminder at 10 or something.  But this could be manually set, I think. Or someone says he wants to do it today, but at latest in the evening at eight, 
[06:29 - 06:35] he wants to have a reminder.  Because otherwise you will forget.  Something like that. Okay. 
[06:38 - 06:46] And did you feel any different about your surroundings?  After using it, obviously. Outside or what? 
[06:48 - 06:54] Any surrounding, just surroundings. After the usage. 
[06:58 - 07:05] Do you feel any different about your surroundings?  No.  Okay, that's fair. I mean, obviously, like in Denmark, but. 
[07:06 - 07:12] Because you can also make pictures at home, so it doesn't have to be outside. Okay. 
[07:13 - 07:25] But did you feel that the app made you more interested in Danish vocabulary? Hello again. 
[07:26 - 07:32] Hello again. Maybe a little bit. 
[07:33 - 07:39] No, you can be honest.  Yeah, I think a little bit. The problem is that some words are not really. 
[07:41 - 07:48] The structure is a bit different when you take photos, because you just learn. I mean, it depends, because if there's a sentence or something. 
[07:50 - 07:57] It's maybe hard.  It's like a different level.  It's not a beginner level.  So you cannot really remember. What it actually means. 
[07:57 - 08:04] If it's a whole sentence and it's like a different level of words. You need to know the grammar first. 
[08:05 - 08:12] That's the curiosity for me.  But if it's simpler words, then. Maybe. 
[08:13 - 08:20] Like if it's only single words.  What's up? I don't know. 
[08:21 - 08:28] So.  So were you more interested or not? Let's keep. 
[08:28 - 08:37] I don't know what you think about to be honest. I'm helping you to think about the whole picture. 
[08:38 - 08:47] I'm the one who connects them. I'm just thinking globally. 
[08:48 - 08:54] No, but that's because that's not really like a philosophical conversation. Okay. 
[08:54 - 09:00] No, I'm not.  So what's the question? If I'm more curious about. 
[09:02 - 09:09] Well, we. Did you feel more interested in Danish vocabulary and potentially in learning it? 
[09:11 - 09:20] Yeah, I think a little bit.  Okay. And did you find the images that others uploaded relevant to you? 
[09:23 - 09:29] So the exercise basically. Well, I mean, well. 
[09:31 - 09:39] Some of the pictures I also want to make.  So when I've seen it, I was like, oh, I also. I already seen it in the app that someone made it from the trash. 
[09:41 - 09:49] You mean like you are you. So something in the city that you wanted to make a picture, but you realize someone already made a picture of it. 
[09:50 - 09:58] Yeah.  Okay. Do you have some comments on the upload flow? 
[09:59 - 10:09] So everything from making the picture to translation to saving it. Kind of neat, unique handy. 
[10:11 - 10:17] What?  It's a neat, unique handy.  I like it. It's good. 
[10:19 - 10:27] Yes.  What do you have any?  Like some improvement. The loading sometimes confusing, but that's already know. 
[10:29 - 10:40] That it's too long or that you don't know if it's loading because there is a loading wheel or it should appear at least. Yeah, there's a loading wheel, but not when it's kind of finished. 
[10:41 - 10:50] Oh, so when it's finished, you're supposed to be taken to the images. But I guess when it takes too long, you just go off and then it never does that. 
[10:51 - 11:03] Yeah, exactly.  Okay. So your comment on the upload flow is that you liked it, but sometimes it was confusing when waiting for too long. 
[11:04 - 11:10] Exactly. And did you consider the app to be somewhat learning tool? 
[11:13 - 11:20] What do you mean? Did you feel like you were learning for it or was it more like fun for you or just curious thing? 
[11:21 - 11:31] Did you feel like it could be something that you learned from? I think the learning is hard to say because it was not. 
[11:33 - 11:43] For that you need to do the month.  See if you learn something. It's hard to reason with me already now. 
[11:46 - 11:56] I think if I would see the science again, then I would be like, oh, yeah, true. So is it like what's the answer to the question? 
[12:06 - 12:16] Yeah, I think it has some impact on the beginning, but I think if there's the level coming really fast, which will stop you from learning. And it will stop people using it. 
[12:17 - 12:30] If you want to go on a better level.  You mean better level in Danish?  Yeah. How easy was the application to use? 
[12:37 - 12:44] Quite simple. I mean, there were only four icons. So it's really minimalistic, stylish, I would say. 
[12:46 - 12:57] So was it easy from scale one to ten? The scale, but yeah, I mean, if one is easy, I think it's one. 
[13:00 - 13:09] And what did you like the most? I mean, I really like the design. 
[13:10 - 13:17] Amazing.  But also in terms of functionalities, I think. But design is also fine. 
[13:18 - 13:24] It's just like taking everything together. Functionality. 
[13:25 - 13:38] Hmm. I mean, sometimes it's too easy. 
[13:39 - 13:47] For example, I don't know what's happening if I click on too easy. So it stopped me from using too easy because I didn't know what would happen. 
[13:48 - 13:56] It's not explained. It's funny. 
[13:56 - 14:03] I think I'm really giving crazy good feedback.  This is what customer research people want to have. And you're just loving it. 
[14:04 - 14:11] Because you would have a yes and a no.  Or like one block of words.  It's good feedback, but it's not the question. But thank you for your feedback. 
[14:14 - 14:21] So what do you think is missing?  So I guess explanation. You just said that what's missing is the explanation. 
[14:21 - 14:31] What does too easy do?  Yeah, exactly.  I would not use it. The lockout button is dangerous. 
[14:32 - 14:38] Because it immediately locks you out.  There's not even a pop-up like, would you like to lockout? Yeah. 
[14:39 - 14:45] What else?  I mean, you have a lot of feedback before. You were telling me about some categories. 
[14:46 - 14:55] And now you're literally saying yes, no answers.  Because before you were like, I should make it more short. So you want to have improvements? 
[14:56 - 15:03] Now the question is open.  What do you think is missing?  So it can be anything you think it should have more. Oh, what should have? 
[15:04 - 15:13] I mean, of course, this reminder thing and the strike.  Because the level itself, it's nice if you reach new levels. But on top for yourself, for the learning process to feel good. 
[15:14 - 15:22] I think this habit thing is a really proven thing. That helps people to keep on track and doing it every day. 
[15:23 - 15:29] Because the level you can also make a two-week break.  Nothing will happen. But if you have a strike and you lose it, you go a bit more crazy. 
[15:30 - 15:38] What do you mean by level?  So some kind of track on the exercise?  How well are you doing? No, like a strike of days, how often do you use it? 
[15:40 - 15:48] Because the Duolingo, my sister has already 700 days strike.  And she's always frustrated about the strike. I remember when I was doing the other one, keep the strike. 
[15:49 - 15:56] But then you get into the habit.  Otherwise, you forget about that. But is the using for you making pictures or just exercises or both? 
[15:57 - 16:06] Both connected.  If I would only, if I would not make pictures. I'm not going to be. 
[16:08 - 16:15] You're not going to what?  No, no, you should say what you think. Yeah, if you, I think if the picture part is the way, the fun part is the way. 
[16:16 - 16:28] Because then it's just like exercising vocabularies with a picture. And you can, this is as dry as having a vocabulary book. 
[16:29 - 16:39] No one will learn it like the vocabulary book.  I think the connection really makes it with the picture. So basically, strike would be when you make a picture a day or something. 
[16:39 - 16:48] Yeah, for example, and then you're also motivated to maybe practice a little bit afterwards. Okay. 
[16:49 - 16:56] I think also it's really important to have your own picture a lot. Like it's nice to see what other people did. 
[16:57 - 17:03] What's so funny? But because the one you made is the one you're curious about. 
[17:04 - 17:10] And if you just see random pictures,  I don't know how she would get that not interested. What's so funny? 
[17:15 - 17:21] It's good.  No, tell me. Nothing is funny. 
[17:21 - 17:33] It's good. Do you think in the future, 
[17:34 - 17:42] is there anything else you would like to add? To the missing. 
[17:53 - 17:59] I think maybe a personal learning book. So. 
[18:00 - 18:06] If you.  Did some vocabularies 10 times, correct? Or let's say 20 times. 
[18:07 - 18:16] I don't know what's the rule of what they do to check the scientific behind it. But if they say, if you make it 30 times, correct, then you know it. 
[18:18 - 18:25] You put it then in the other library, which is like your knowledge, which you already have. Wait, so it doesn't show the same time. 
[18:26 - 18:33] So if you know something and you got it correct many times, you're not able to see it anymore. What's the idea? 
[18:33 - 18:39] You have to put it in another library. Just in school, where you also have different parts. 
[18:40 - 18:46] Once you know it, you put it once more back.  And then it comes up once a week. And if you know it then, it comes back one month. 
[18:47 - 18:57] And then every month you have it only.  And then after one year, it comes again. You put words you know always a bit deeper and not that regularly anymore in the library. 
[18:58 - 19:04] So like a space repetition algorithm.  It's called. Call it like that. 
[19:08 - 19:14] But I mean, yeah, because otherwise, if you have. If you see the pictures regularly all the time, you're like getting angry. 
[19:14 - 19:21] I think it didn't happen yet because I'm completely new to the whole area.  Yeah, you know. But what about. 
[19:23 - 19:31] Like you said before, it was about these categories when you were talking.  Now you didn't mention it. The category. 
[19:34 - 19:41] I mean, like similar or multiple words.  That's what you were saying. The singular words and multiple words. 
[19:42 - 19:48] You were saying to categorize pictures like, I don't know, signs. I think you said it to me in private. 
[19:49 - 20:02] Oh yeah, I'm a bit.  What? I mean, it's hard to categorize because there's only signs you can photograph. 
[20:03 - 20:09] No, you can make, for example, a newspaper article picture or a food picture. A lot of stuff. 
[20:10 - 20:17] But I don't think it makes sense because you can maximum take a sentence. Or words. 
[20:17 - 20:23] So I think the category doesn't really change the wordings.  Okay. I mean, that's not your idea. 
[20:23 - 20:34] So that's not the idea anymore. No, if I think about it, I think it doesn't make a big difference. 
[20:35 - 20:42] If I'm having a word from the newspaper or from the street sign. Yeah, but you could have something like, okay, whatever. 
[20:42 - 20:48] It's fine. My idea is what's more important is to categorize words or sentences. 
[20:50 - 20:58] What do you mean? Yeah, that sometimes I just get, if I only want to learn words right now, 
[20:58 - 21:08] I just want to have vocabularies, singular vocabularies.  And not sentences. I think sentences, if I think about learning books, always level up already 
[21:08 - 21:14] because then you know the connections. Like from I have croissants. 
[21:14 - 21:23] Oh, so you would have category like one word or a whole sentence?  Yeah. So more about the kind of the length or difficulty of it. 
[21:23 - 21:33] Yeah, because I think the longer... For the exercises that could be used when you want to first just have the simple words 
[21:33 - 21:39] and then the next difficulty could be sentences.  Yeah. Okay. 
[21:39 - 21:45] So the last question is, would you advise the app to somebody else? Definitely, yes. 
[21:46 - 21:56] No, but don't be biased. I would recommend it to everyone who's new to the country 
[21:57 - 22:08] and just wants to have a little bit of fun and like see where the language is going. Okay, great. 
[22:09 - 22:11] But if someone already learns...
